ClojureScript is an excellent alternative to JavaScript for client side application logic. Some of the advantages of using ClojureScript include:

* use the same language on both the client and the server
* share common code between the front-end and back-end
* cleaner and more consistent language
* dependency management via Leiningen
* immutable data structures
* powerful standard library

### Adding ClojureScript Support

ClojureScript support can be added via the official `:cljs` module. Simply run `(kit/install-module :cljs)` in oder to add the assets.

### Using Libraries

One advantage of using ClojureScript is that it allows managing your client-side libraries using Leiningen. ClojureScript libraries are included under dependencies in the `project.clj` just like any other library.

### Running the Compiler

The easiest way to develop ClojureScript applications is to run the compiler in `watch` mode. This way any changes you make in your namespaces will be recompiled automatically and become immediately available on the page. To start the compiler in this mode simply run:

```
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

This will start shadow-cljs compiler and connect a browser REPL. Any changes you make in ClojureScript source will now be automatically reloaded on the page.

ClojureScript will be compiled with production settings when the uberjar task is run.

### ClojureScript with nREPL

To connect the IDE to a ClojureScript REPL make sure that you have the `:nrepl` key in `shadow-cljs.edn`. This key defaults to port `7002`. When  starts, it will open nREPL on the specified port.

Once you run `npx shadow watch app`, then you'll be able to connect to its nREPL at `localhost:7002`. Once connected, you simply have to run `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/repl :app)` and the ClojureScript nREPL will become available. You can test that everything is working correctly by running `(js/alert "Hi")` in the REPL. This should pop up an alert in the browser.

To exit the ClojureScript nREPL you have to run `:cljs/quit` in the nREPL.

#### shadow-cljs with nREPL

By default, kit configures shadow-cljs' nrepl to run on port 7002. Once you connect to the nREPL you simply have to run `(shadow/repl :app)` to connect to the ClojureScript nREPL.

To exit the ClojureScript nREPL you have to run `:cljs/quit` in the nREPL.

#### Self-managed package.json

By default, luminus configures lein-shadow to store npm dependencies in a `:npm-deps` key in the project.clj file. Sometimes, you may wish to self-manage these, in order to expand on the package.json config. To do this, you have to remove the `:npm-deps` key from your project.clj file, and create a `package.json` file instead. Now lein-shadow will skip checking for npm dependencies on execution, and you will have to manually run `npm install` and update your `package.json` accordingly.

### Interacting with JavaScript

All the global JavaScript functions and variables are available via the `js` namespace.

#### Method Calls

```clojure
(.method object params)

(.log js/console "hello world!")
```

#### Accessing Properties

```clojure
(.-property object)

(.-style div)
```

#### Setting Properties

```clojure
(set! (.-property object))

(set! (.-color (.-style div) "#234567"))
```

### Reagent

[Reagent](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/) is the recommended approach for building ClojureScript applications with kit.

Reagent is backed by [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and provides an extremely efficient way to manipulate the DOM using [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) style syntax. In Reagent, each UI component is simply a data structure that represents a particular DOM element. By taking a DOM-centric view of the UI, Reagent makes writing composable components simple and intuitive.

A simple Reagent component looks as follows:

```clojure
[:label "Hello World"]
```

Components can also be functions:

```clojure
(defn label [text]
  [:label text])
```

The values of the components are stored in Reagent atoms. These atoms behave just like regular Clojure atoms, except for one important property. When an atom is updated it causes any components that dereference it to be repainted. Let's take a look at an example.

**Important:** Make sure that you require Reagent atom in the namespace, otherwise regular Clojure atoms will be used and components will not be repainted on change.

```clojure
(ns myapp
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent :refer [atom]]))

(def state (atom nil))

(defn input-field [label-text]
  [:div
    [label label-text]
    [:input {:type "text"
             :value @state
             :on-change #(reset! state (-> % .-target .-value))}]])
```

Above, the `input-field` component consists of a `label` component we defined earlier and an `:input` component. The input will update the `state` atom and render it as its value.

Notice that even though `label` is a function we're not calling it, but instead we're putting it in a vector. The reason for this is that we're specifying the component hierarchy. The components will be run by Reagent when they need to be rendered.

This is behavior makes it trivial to implement the [React Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) pattern.

```
Views--->(actions) --> Dispatcher-->(callback)--> Stores---+
É…                                                          |
|                                                          V
+--(event handlers update)--(Stores emit "change" events)--+
```

Our view components dispatch updates to the atoms, which represent the stores. The atoms in turn notify any components that dereference them when their state changes.

In the previous example, we used a global atom to hold the state. While it's convenient for small applications this approach doesn't scale well. Fortunately, Reagent allows us to have localized states in our components. Let's take a look at how this works.

```clojure
(defn input-field [label-text id]
  (let [value (atom nil)]
    (fn []
      [:div
        [label "The value is: " @value]
        [:input {:type "text"
                 :value @value
                 :on-change #(reset! value (-> % .-target .-value))}]])))
```

All we have to do is create a local binding for the atom inside a closure. The returned function is what's going to be called by Reagent when the value of the atom changes.

Finally, rendering components is accomplished by calling the `render-component` function:

```clojure
(defn render-simple []
  (reagent/render-component [input-field]
                            (.-body js/document))
```

A working sample project can be found [here](https://github.com/yogthos/reagent-example). For a real world application using Reagent see the [Yuggoth blog engine](https://github.com/yogthos/yuggoth).

### Client Side Routing

Reitit is used to handle both client and server routes.
We'd need to require Reitit in the routing namespace along
with Google Closure history and events helpers.

```clojure
(ns <app>.core
 (:require
  [reagent.core :as r]
  [reitit.core :as reitit]
  [goog.events :as events]
  [goog.history.EventType :as HistoryEventType])
 (:import goog.History))
```

We'll now add a session atom to hold the selected page along with a couple of pages:

```clojure
(def session (r/atom {:page :home}))

(defn home-page []
  [:div "Home"])
  
(defn about-page []
  [:div "About"])

(def pages
  {:home #'home-page
   :about #'about-page})
```

We can now create a `page` function that will check the state of the session and render
the appropriate page:

```clojure
(defn page []
  [(pages (:page @session))])
```

We can now add a route that will dispatch the key associated with each page when the route is selected:

```clojure
(def router
  (reitit/router
    [["/" :home]
     ["/about" :about]]))     
```

Finally, we'll add functions to match routes and hook into browser navigation:

```clojure
(defn match-route [uri]
  (->> (or (not-empty (string/replace uri #"^.*#" "")) "/")
       (reitit/match-by-path router)
       :data
       :name))

(defn hook-browser-navigation! []
  (doto (History.)
    (events/listen
      HistoryEventType/NAVIGATE
      (fn [event]
        (swap! session assoc :page (match-route (.-token event)))))
    (.setEnabled true)))
```

When the `hook-browser-navigation!` is called it will hook into page events and call the `match-route` function
when the page navigation event is dispatched.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://metosin.github.io/reitit/) for further details.

### Working With the DOM directly

#### Warning

Since Reagent uses a virtual DOM and renders components as necessary, direct manipulation of the DOM is highly discouraged. Updating DOM elements outside the Reagent components can result in unpredictable behavior.

That said, there are several libraries available for accessing and modifying DOM elements. In particular, you may wish  to take a look at the [Domina](https://github.com/levand/domina) and [Dommy](https://github.com/Prismatic/dommy). Domina is a lightweight library for selecting and manipulating DOM elements as well as handling events. Dommy is a templating library similar to Hiccup.

### Ajax

Luminus uses [cljs-ajax](https://github.com/JulianBirch/cljs-ajax) for handling Ajax operations. The library provides an easy way to send Ajax queries to the server using `ajax-request`, `GET`, and `POST` functions.

#### ajax-request

The `ajax-request` is the base request function that accepts the following parameters:

* uri - the URI for the request
* method - a string representing the HTTP request type, eg: "PUT", "DELETE", etc.
* format - a keyword indicating the response format, can be either `:raw`, `:json`, `:edn`, or `:transit` and defaults to `:transit`
* handler - success handler, a function that accepts the response as a single argument
* error-handler - error handler, a function that accepts a map representing the error with keys `:status` and `:status-text`
* params - a map of params to be sent to the server

#### GET/POST helpers

The `GET` and `POST` helpers accept a URI followed by a map of options:

* `:handler` - the handler function for successful operation should accept a single parameter which is the deserialized response
* `:error-handler` - the handler function for errors, should accept a map with keys `:status` and `:status-text`
* `:format` - the format for the request can be either `:raw`, `:json`, `:edn`, or `:transit` and defaults to `:transit`
* `:response-format` - the response format. If you leave this blank, it will detect the format from the Content-Type header
* `:params` - a map of parameters that will be sent with the request
* `:timeout` - the ajax call's timeout. 30 seconds if left blank
* `:headers` - a map of the HTTP headers to set with the request
* `:finally` - a function that takes no parameters and will be triggered during the callback in addition to any other handlers


```clojure
(ns foo
  (:require [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]]))

(defn handler [response]
  (.log js/console (str response)))

(defn error-handler [{:keys [status status-text]}]
  (.log js/console
    (str "something bad happened: " status " " status-text)))

(GET "/hello")

(GET "/hello" {:handler handler})

(POST "/hello")

(POST "/send-message"
        {:headers {"Accept" "application/transit+json"}
         :params {:message "Hello World"
                  :user    "Bob"}
         :handler handler
         :error-handler error-handler})
```

In the example above, the `handler` will be invoked when the server responds with a success status. The response handler function should accept a single parameter. The parameter will contain the deserialized response from the server.

The library attempts to automatically discover the encoding based on the response headers, however the response format can be specified explicitly using the `:response-format` key.

The `error-handler` function is expected to to accept a single parameter that contains the error response. The function will receive the entire response map that contains the status and the description of the error along with any data returned by the server.

* `:status` - contains the HTTP status code
* `:status-text` - contains the textual description of the status
* `:original-text` - contains the server response text
* `:response` - contains the deserialized response when if deserialization was successful

When no handler function is supplied then no further action is taken after the request is sent to the server.

The request body will be interpreted using the [ring-middleware-format](https://github.com/ngrunwald/ring-middleware-format) library. The library will deserialize the request based on the `Content-Type` header and serialize the response using the `Accept` header that we set above.

The route should simply return a response map with the body set to the content of the response:

```clojure
(ns myapp.routes.services
  (:require
   [ring.util.response :refer [response status]]))

(defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]
  (println params)
  (response {:status :success}))

(defroutes services
  (POST "/send-message" request (save-message! request)))
```

Note that CSRF middleware is enabled by default. The middleware wraps the `home-routes` in the `handler` namespace of
your application. It will intercept any request to the server that isn't a `HEAD` or `GET`.

```clojure
(def app
  (-> (routes
        (wrap-routes home-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
        base-routes)
      middleware/wrap-base))
```

The middleware is applied by `wrap-routes` after the routes are resolved and does not affect other route definitions.
If we wish the services to be accessible to external client then we would update the routes to contain the `service-routes` as seen below.

```clojure
(ns myapp.handler
  (:require ...
            [myapp.routes.services :refer [service-routes]]))

(def app
  (-> (routes
        service-routes ;; no CSRF protection
        (wrap-routes home-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
        base-routes)
      middleware/wrap-base))
```

Alternatively, we could wrap the `service-routes` using `wrap-csrf` middleware as seen with `home-routes`:

```clojure
(def app
  (-> (routes
        (wrap-routes service-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
        (wrap-routes home-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
        base-routes)
      middleware/wrap-base))
```

We would now need to pass the CSRF token along with the request. One way to do this is to pass the token in the `x-csrf-token` header in the request with the value of the token.

To do that we'll first need to set the token as a hidden field on the page:

```xml
<input id="csrf-token" type="hidden" value="{{csrf-token}}"></input>
```

Then we'll have to set the header in the request:

```clojure
(POST "/send-message"
        {:headers {"Accept" "application/transit+json"
                   "x-csrf-token" (.-value (.getElementById js/document "csrf-token"))}
         :params {:message "Hello World"
                  :user    "Bob"}
         :handler handler
         :error-handler error-handler})
```
