# Kit Documentation

This repository contains the [kit-clj](https://github.com/kit-clj/kit) documentation which is 
deployed at <https://kit-clj.github.io>.

## Development

To add or update the documentation, make your changes to the Markdown files in `resources/md`. You can then use `lein run` (or run `kit.core/-main` 
from a repl) to generate the HTML output into the `static` directory.
